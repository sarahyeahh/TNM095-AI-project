## Täppan (elevator or stairs): When to wait for an elevator

People enter Täppan in different group sizes and depending on whether the elevator is
empty or not and how long time they will have to wait for it to be available, they will decide
whether to take the elevator or the stairs.

### Factors:
* Group size: Single, pair, larger group
* Wait estimate
* Stressed or not: in a rush or have time to wait
* Energetic or not: lazy for full of energy
* Levels
* Willing to split a larger group in two

The user can interact with the system by adding elevators, stairs, number of levels in the
building, and group sizes.

### Proposed algorithms
* Decision Trees
* Travelling Salesman
